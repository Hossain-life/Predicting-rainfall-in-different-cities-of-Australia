# Predicting-rainfall-in-different-cities-of-Australia

My goals is to utilise both analysis and visualisation of the datasets to produce a robust report and model of the impact of the varying weather elements in predicting rainfall.

The datasets include daily readings of:

Rainfall
Minimum and Maximum Temperature
Solar Exposure
Wind Speed and Direction
Air Pressure
Humidity
Looking at this data for the past 10 years for the Sydney Observatory Hill weather station (station code: 066062), I am looking at how effective these factors are at predicting rainfall.
